You will also notice that weâ€™re storing the Elasticsearch data in a volume outside of the container by specifying - esdata01:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data The two primary reasons for this are performance and data persistence. If we were to leave the data directory inside the container, we would see a significant degradation in the performance of our Elasticsearch node, as well as lose data anytime we needed to change the configuration of the container within our docker-compose file.
